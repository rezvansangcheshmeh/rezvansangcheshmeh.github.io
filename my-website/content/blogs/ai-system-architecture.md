Designing scalable AI system architecture requires careful consideration of data pipelines, model serving, monitoring, and infrastructure. In this post, I'll share patterns from building production AI systems.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. **Data Pipeline Architecture**
- Real-time data ingestion and processing
- Feature store design and implementation
- Data validation and quality monitoring
- Batch vs stream processing trade-offs

### 2. **Model Serving Infrastructure**
- Model registry and version management
- A/B testing and canary deployments
- Auto-scaling for inference workloads
- GPU resource optimization

## MLOps Best Practices

### CI/CD for Machine Learning
- Automated model training pipelines
- Model evaluation and validation
- Deployment strategies and rollback procedures
- Environment consistency across stages

### Monitoring and Observability
- Model performance monitoring
- Data drift detection
- Infrastructure metrics and alerting
- Cost optimization and resource utilization

## Scalability Patterns

### Horizontal Scaling
- Load balancing across multiple model servers
- Database sharding for feature stores
- Distributed training architectures
- Caching strategies for inference results

### Performance Optimization
- Model quantization and compression
- Hardware acceleration strategies
- Network optimization for distributed systems
- Memory management and garbage collection
