Large Language Models have revolutionized how we build intelligent applications. In this post, I'll share practical integration patterns for deploying LLMs in production environments.

## Integration Architecture Patterns

### 1. **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**
- Vector database integration
- Document chunking strategies
- Context window optimization
- Semantic search implementation

### 2. **Agent-based Systems**
- Tool calling and function execution
- Multi-step reasoning chains
- Memory management for conversations
- Error handling and recovery

## Production Considerations

### Performance & Cost
- Model quantization for efficiency
- Caching strategies for common queries
- Load testing and scaling
- Cost monitoring and optimization

### Security & Reliability
- Prompt injection prevention
- Output validation and filtering
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Monitoring and alerting
