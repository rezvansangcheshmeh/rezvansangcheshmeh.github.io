![Real-time Computer Vision Architecture](/images/blog/real-time-vision-architecture.jpg)

Building real-time computer vision systems requires careful architectural planning to balance performance, accuracy, and scalability. In this guide, I'll share patterns and best practices from my experience developing production computer vision systems.

## Key Architecture Components

### 1. **Video Stream Processing Pipeline**
- Multi-threaded frame capture and processing
- GPU acceleration with CUDA
- Batch processing optimization
- Memory management strategies

### 2. **Model Serving Infrastructure**
- TensorFlow Serving vs Triton Inference Server
- Model versioning and A/B testing
- Dynamic batching for throughput optimization
- Resource allocation and scaling

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### Latency Reduction
- Model quantization and pruning
- Pipeline parallelization
- Hardware-specific optimizations
- Caching strategies for repeated inferences

### Throughput Maximization  
- Async processing patterns
- Load balancing across multiple GPUs
- Efficient frame sampling
- Distributed processing architectures
